# Calculator
1.Html with 20 buttons with different events onclick and 2 divs where the equations and results will appear
2.Css to make it pleasant to the eye with grid and flex
3.Javscript that verifies if what we insert is a number or a sign: if it s a number we add it to a string declared globally that's empty and if it's a sign we push the expression that we had before into a list of numbers, the sign in another list and we use a function that calculates every two numbers by accessing the lists and showing the result.
The calculator has clasic buttons like Clear Entry (CE), Clear (C) or delete last char
